Zulip Mobile is the official mobile Zulip client supporting both iOS and Android, written in JavaScript with React Native. It supersedes our two native apps [zulip-ios](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-ios-legacy) and [zulip-android](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-android).

All contributors to our previous projects, as well as newcomers, are welcome to contribute. If you are current Android contributor, read more about our
